# Project Overview

This document lists and describes various GitHub projects and pages which are relevant to my work. This is a living document and will be updated regularly to highlight new ideas and directions.

The document is divided into four main sections: Pre-Release (Private) Projects, Public Projects, Projects from DeepLearning.AI, etc, and Projects Inspired by Others.
